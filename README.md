# Classification Model On MNIST 

This project focuses on classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using the Support Vector Classifier (SVC) algorithm. 
To improve the modelâ€™s accuracy, I used GridSearchCV to tune hyperparameters like C, gamma, and kernel. After training and optimization, 
the model achieved an accuracy of 98% on the test data, demonstrating high performance in recognizing digits from images.
